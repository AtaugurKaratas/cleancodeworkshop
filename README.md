# Clean Code Workshop (Java)

A full-day, hands-on Java kit with intentionally **dirty** code and **clean** reference implementations.

## What’s inside
- **6 solo exercises** (30–40 min each)
- **3 group/mob exercises** (60–90 min)
- Each exercise has: motivation, step-by-step plan, tests, and (in this package) a clean solution with rationale.

## Run
```bash
mvn -q -T 1C test
mvn -q -pl 01-naming-magicnumbers -am test
```
