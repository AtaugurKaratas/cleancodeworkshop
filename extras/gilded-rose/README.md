# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata (Java)
**Motivation:** Practice incremental refactoring under strict legacy constraints by building a golden master, then improving design.

## How to Use (students)
1) Clone one of the Java versions of Gilded Rose from GitHub into this folder.
2) Write a **golden master** test capturing current behavior.
3) Incrementally refactor: isolate update rules, introduce strategy per item type.

**What you learn**
- Characterization testing
- Open-Closed Principle under legacy code
