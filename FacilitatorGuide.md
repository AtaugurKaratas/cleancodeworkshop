# Facilitator Guide

## Warm-up
- Boy Scout Rule. Small steps. Run tests every minute.
- Optimize for readability, not cleverness. Name things well.

## Formats
- Randori: 5' driver, 1 navigator, rotate.
- Naming Jam: rename/extract only for 10 min, no logic changes.

## Debrief Prompts
- What smells did you target first? Why?
- How did refactoring change complexity (#branches, params, LOC)?
- What abstractions emerged? Did dependencies face inward (stable)?
